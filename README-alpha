This is GNU tar.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet.
Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-tar@gnu.org>.

If you have taken the sources from CVS you will need the following packages
to build the package:

autoconf 2.57
automake 1.7.5
bison 1.875
gettext 0.12.1
wget 1.7

Before building the package, run bootstrap. You will need a POSIX
compliant shell to do so. The bootstrap utility obtains various
additional files from the CVS repository and the Translation Project
site and prepares the source directory for building. The exact way
of invoking bootstrap depends on whether you have the sources for gnulib
installed somewhere on your system and on the method you use to access
the CVS at savannah.

If you already have gnulib sources on your machine, run:

	./bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=DIRNAME

Otherwise, if you have developer's access to savannah:

a) if you access CVS via ssh, set the environment variable CVS_RSH
to ssh and run ./bootstrap without arguments.

b) if you access CVS via Kerberos, run

        ./bootstrap --cvs-auth=gserver

Othervise, if you are not a member of Savannah, run

        ./bootstrap --cvs-auth=pserver

When prompted for a password for anoncvs, simply press the Enter key.
