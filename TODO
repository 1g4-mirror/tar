Suggestions for improving GNU tar.

* Incorporate fixes from major distributions, e.g., Debian GNU/Linux.

* Fix tar so that it can read and write POSIX.1-1990 tar archives.

* Add support for POSIX 1003.1-2001 tar archives
  (along with technical corrections to the standard since 2001).

* Add support for a 'pax' command that conforms to POSIX 1003.1-2001.
  This would unify paxutils with tar.

* Remove command-line incompatibilities between GNU tar and UNIX tar
  as specified by UNIX98.  The main problem is:

     l   GNU tar doesn't cross filesystem boundaries.
	 UNIX98 tar warns if all links cannot be resolved.
	   (GNU tar --check-links option)

  Perhaps we could announce a phase-in period where "l" changes in semantics.
  In the meanwhile we could make the "l" semantics to be determined by the
  value of POSIXLY_CORRECT variable.

* Interoperate better with Joerg Schilling's star implementation.

* Add an option to remove files that compare successfully.

  It would be useful to be able to use '--remove-files' with '--diff',
  to remove all files that compare successfully, when verifying a backup.
