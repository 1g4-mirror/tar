Hey!  Emacs!  Yo!  This is -*- Text -*- !!!
This GNU tar 1.11.  Please send bug reports, etc., to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  This is a beta-test release.  

GNU tar is based heavily on John Gilmore's public domain tar, but with
added features.  The manual is currently being written.  An old
manual, surely riddled with errors, is in tar.texinfo.  Please don't
send in bug reports about that manual.  In particular, the mechanism
for doing incremental dumps has been significantly changed.

This distribution also includes rmt, the remote tape server (which
must reside in /etc).  The mt program is in the GNU cpio distribution.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions for Unix.

makefile.pc is a makefile for Turbo C 2.0 on MS-DOS.

Various people have been having problems using floppies on a NeXT.
I've gotten conflicting reports about what should be done to solve the
problems, and we have no way to test it ourselves.

If you want to do incremental dumps, use the distributed backup
scripts.  They are what we use at the FSF

User-visible changes since 1.10:
